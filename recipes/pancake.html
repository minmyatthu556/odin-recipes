    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>This German apple pancake is also known as a Dutch baby. 
        It is a terrific pancake recipe for those special occasions. 
        If you are strapped for time, you can start it the evening 
        before and pretty much pop it in the oven. The presentation is 
        excellent!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ts vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 ts unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 ts ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 ts ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 ts ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 large tart apple - peeled, cored and sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine eggs, flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking powder, 
            and salt in a large bowl; gradually mix in milk, stirring constantly. 
            Add vanilla, melted butter, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. Let batter stand 
            for 30 minutes or overnight. 
        </li>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a 10-inch oven-proof skillet, brushing butter up 
            on the sides of the pan. Combine 1/4 cup sugar, cinnamon, and 
            1/2 teaspoon nutmeg in a small bowl; sprinkle sugar mixture over the butter. 
            Line the pan with apple slices. Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 cup sugar over apples. 
            Place pan over medium-high heat until the mixture bubbles, 
            then gently pour batter mixture over apples. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) 
            and bake for 10 minutes more. Slide pancake onto a serving platter and cut into wedges.
